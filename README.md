# Compiler-

University project -  Scheme compiler.

It compiles Scheme code to a pseudo-assembly language defined by C macros in the arch/ directory. For further details please read https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~comp171/wiki.files/proj.pdf. 

The target assembly language file should be compilable via gcc. If the name of the file is foo.c,
performing at the Linux shell prompt the following:
% gcc -o foo foo.c
